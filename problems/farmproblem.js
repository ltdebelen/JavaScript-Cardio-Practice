/*
In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

chickens = 2 legs
cows = 4 legs
pigs = 4 legs

The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

Ex: animals(2, 3, 5) âžž 36
*/

function animals(chicken, cows, pigs) {
  return chicken * 2 + cows * 4 + pigs * 4;
}

console.log(animals(2, 3, 5));
